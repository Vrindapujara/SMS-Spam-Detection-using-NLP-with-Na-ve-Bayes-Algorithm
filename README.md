# SMS-Spam-Detection-using-NLP-with-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm

This repository contains a Python project for SMS spam detection utilizing Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) along with Naive Bayes algorithms. The project is structured into distinct stages for efficient development and deployment. The initial phase involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The data cleaning process is facilitated by Pandas and NumPy libraries, ensuring the dataset is prepared for further analysis. During EDA, NLTK is employed to extract features like character count, word count, and sentence count, enhancing our understanding of the dataset's composition.

In the subsequent phase, data preprocessing and model building are performed in separate modules. Leveraging NLTK, the text data is preprocessed by converting it to lowercase, tokenizing, removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters, followed by stemming. Additionally, the most frequently occurring words in both spam and ham data are identified, aiding in feature selection. Model building involves training the data using three variants of Naive Bayes algorithms. The data is vectorized using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF methods to compare their efficacy in model performance. Finally, the trained model is deployed using Heroku, where an API is built using PyCharm, allowing seamless integration into other applications for real-time spam detection.

This project provides a comprehensive solution for SMS spam detection, offering insights into the data through EDA, employing effective preprocessing techniques, and implementing Naive Bayes algorithms for model training. By deploying the model as an API, it ensures accessibility and ease of use, making it applicable for various applications requiring SMS spam detection. Contributions and feedback are welcomed to further enhance the project's capabilities and applicability.

# SMS-Spam-Detection-using-NLP-with-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm

This Python project leverages NLTK and Naive Bayes algorithms for SMS spam detection, structured into distinct phases. Initial data cleaning and EDA, facilitated by Pandas, NumPy, and NLTK, ensure a well-prepared dataset with extracted features such as character, word, and sentence counts. In the subsequent phase, data preprocessing and model building occur separately. NLTK aids in text preprocessing, including lowercasing, tokenizing, punctuation removal, stop word elimination, and stemming. Key features, like most frequent words in spam and ham data, aid in model training. Three Naive Bayes variants are trained, and data is vectorized using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF methods for comparative analysis. Finally, the model is deployed on Heroku as an API, enabling seamless integration into various applications for real-time spam detection.

This project offers a robust solution for SMS spam detection by employing EDA insights, effective preprocessing techniques, and Naive Bayes algorithms. Deploying the model as an API ensures accessibility and usability across diverse applications. Contributions and feedback are encouraged to further refine and broaden the project's utility and effectiveness in tackling SMS spam detection challenges.
